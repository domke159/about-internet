      <h2>What is the Internet?</h2>
      <p>Internet is a networking infrastructure that allows hardware devices to physically connect to one another. The Internet provides so many capabilites
        that it revolutionised the world we live in. It is easily accessible and allows people to share information, communicate and even carry out various
        transactions. These days internet is so big that estimated amount of information that courses through it is about five exabytes a day. That’s equivalent
        to 40,000 two-hour standard definition movies per second.</p>
      <p class="list-paragraph">Internet protocols (IP) specify how the transactionson the internet are carried out:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How communication is initiated and maintained.</li>
        <li>Type, size and structure of the data sent/received.</li>
        <li>They enable the services running over the internet.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="information" id="clients">
      <h2>Clients, Servers and Peers</h2>
      <p>Most common internet services are based on a client/server model using appropriate communication protocols. Client-server is a system that performs both 
        the functions of the client and server so as to promote the sharing of information between them. It allows users to have access to the same database at
        the same time, the place where the information is stored.</p>
      <p class="list-paragraph">Usually local software clients access centralised remote servers. Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Email via an Outlook client accessing an ISP's mail server.</li>
        <li>Web pages via a Firefox web client accessing an Apache web server.</li>
        <li>Bank custommer accesses online banking services with a web browser (the client), the client initiates a request to the bank's server.</li>
        <li>People using social media services where the server of the social media company is accessed by the users.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="list-paragraph">Peer-to-peer technology is a network where two or more computers are connected and share resources between them without going
        through a separate server computer. P2P technology can directly connect multiple computers - each acting as both client and server:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Responsibly implemented Peer-to-Peer can be very efficient for data-rich services.</li>
        <li>Distributed download, media on demand, VOIP/video calling etc.</li>
        <li>All the cryptocurrencies work according to Peer-to-peer technology principle.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="empty"></div>
    <div class="information" id="protocols">
      <h2>Protocols</h2>
      <p class="list-paragraph">As mentioned previously, protocols are a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices. They specify
         how the transactions on the internet are carried out. Before sending any kind of information on the internet there must exist preexisting agreement
         as to how that information will be structured and how each side will send and receive it. Without protocols computers would not have the capability
         to "communicate" to each other. Clients and servers typically use a combination of protocols to provide specific services to the users:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Web access</li>
        <li>Email</li>
        <li>File transfer</li>
        <li>Peer-to-peer data exchange</li>
        <li>Chat/instant messaging</li>
        <li>Shell/console access to computers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most common protocols in use today are those associated with web and email services - HTTP/HTTPS, SMTP/IMAP/POP etc.</p>

      <h3>TCP/IP: The heart of the Internet</h3>
      <p class="list-paragraph">Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) are two distinct computer network protocols. TCP transport
        is used to deliver data across IP networks. TCP/IP functionality is divided into four layers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The datalink layer - consists of methods and protocols that operate only on a link (network component that interconnects nodes or hosts in the network).</li>
        <li>The internet (or networking) layer - connects independent networks to transport the packets containing the data across network.</li>
        <li>The transport layer - handles communications between hosts and is responsible for flow control, reliability, and multiplexing.</li>
        <li>The application layer - standardizes data exchange for applications.</li>
      </ul>     
      <p>Transmission Control protocol and Internet Protocol have different purposes:</p>
      <p class="list-paragraph">TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Handles direct connection on computer between client/server software and network interfaces.</li>
        <li>Breaks outgoing messages from application into packets to send via IP. Packet is a unit of data that travels along a given network path.
            Packets have two parts: header (addressing/sequencing information and metadata) and body (actual data payload).</li>
        <li>Assembles incoming packets into messages to pass back to application.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="list-paragraph">IP (Internet Protocol):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Handles delivery of packets to/from any device with an IP address - a unique numeric identifier for a device on the internet e.g. <span>128.240.233.249</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>IP routes packets using address info in the header to direct them to their destination. IP routing is connection-less and does not require a fixed
         connection between endpoints. It enables data to travel via multiple routes to reach endpoint. One "wire" can handle multiple connections/services. 
         If the failure occurs packets can be re-routed. However this proccess has some risks. Data might be corrupted, packets might get lost or they might 
         duplicate. Also, packets might be delivered out of sequence (e.g. ent A -> B, received B -> A). </p>
      <p>As a result IP only promises best-effort-delivery. Performance of IP routing can be affected by various factors.
         Unpredictability means IP cannot guarantee that all packets will arrive within a fixed time, in correct order, or at all.
         To reduce the severity of this problem, TCP on destination device checks and reassembles packets based on header information and can request re-transmission 
         of lost/corrupted packets, correctly re-sequence packets, refuse to accept or wait for any more (drop connection).</p>
      <h3>Domain Names</h3>
      <p>Domain names make internet easier (for humans) to use by mapping numeric IP addresses to text-based names e.g. 
         <span>128.240.233.249 &#60;&#61;&#62; www.netskills.ac.uk</span>. In simple words, a domain name is the name (URL) of your website. When device makes a request 
         using a domain name it is resolved back into a numeric IP address by a DNS server. New domain registrations are automatically propagated
         across global DNS system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="empty"></div>
    <div class="information" id="servers">
      <h2>Servers</h2>
      <p>A server is a computer designed to process requests and deliver data to another computer over the internet or a local network. Web server listens
         on an open network port for incoming HTTP requests and responds accordingly. Any computer running specific software can function as a server.
         However, server normally refers to the high-powered machines that function as the pumps pushing and pulling data from the internet.</p>

    <div class="empty"></div>
    <div class="information" id="architecture">
      <h2>Web architecture: HTTP, URIs and URLs</h2>
      <p class="list-paragraph">Key web architecture components are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol. It allows communication between different systems and is used for transferring data from a web server to a browser to view web pages.</li>
        <li>URI: Uniform Resource Identifier - formatted string that identifies a resource.</li>
        <li>HTML/XHTML - HyperText Markup Language/eXtensible HyperText Markup Language. Used to create electronic documents (pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web.</li>
        <li>DNS - Domain Name System. The Internet's system for converting alphabetic names into numeric IP addresses.</li>
        <li>TCP/IP - Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. A set of rules and procedures that define how data is exchanged.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>HyperText Transfer Protocol is what makes the Web work. Clients ask for resources from servers by assembling and sending
         an HTTP request message and servers respond with the appropriate HTTP response message, including any content to be displayed.
         HTTP requests and responses travel as TCP/IP packets (metadata in headers and content in an (optional) entity body).</p>
      <p>HTTP is stateless. Each request/response pair is an independent exchange. No protocol level maintenance of state (for scalability) is required.</p>
      <h3>Common HTTP methods</h3>
      <!-- Table for data -->
      <table id="methods">
        <tr>
          <th>Method</th>
          <th class="centered">Use</th> 
          <th class="centered">Safe</th> 
          <th class="centered">Idempotent</th> 
          <th class="centered">Mandatory</th>
        </tr> 
        <tr>
          <td>HEAD</td>
          <td>Exchange of request/response headers</td> 
          <td class="centered">Yes</td> 
          <td class="centered">Yes</td> 
          <td class="centered">Yes</td> 
        </tr>  
        <tr>
          <td>GET</td>
          <td>Request and return the current state and content of a resource e.g. access a web page</td> 
          <td class="centered">Yes</td>

          <td class="centered">No</td> 
          <td class="centered">No</td> 
          <td class="centered">No</td> 
        </tr>  
        <tr>
          <td>PUT</td>
          <td>Server stores entity body contents  at request URI location e.g. file uploads</td> 
          <td class="centered">No</td>

          <td class="centered">No</td> 
        </tr>  
      </table>
      <h3>HTTP Headers</h3>
      <p>Headers are the metadata for the request/response exchange. They allow the client and the server to pass additional information with the request or the response.
         Some are generic and apply to both request and response e.g. Date (date/time stamp for the message), Cache-Control (instructions for en-route caching).</p>
      <h3>Uniform Resource Identifier</h3>  
      <p class="list-paragraph">A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a sequence of characters that identifies a logical or physical resource. There are two types of URIs:</p>
      <ul id="uri-list">
        <li>Uniform Resource Locator (URL) - this type of URI states which protocol should be used to locate and access the physical or logical resource on a network.
            URLs are not persistent. If the resource’s location changes, the URL also needs to to be changed to point to the new location.</li>
        <li>Uniform Resource Name (URN) - this type of URI labels the resource with a persistent, location-independent unique identifier. It never changes
            throughout its lifetime.</li>
      </ul>
