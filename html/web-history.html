      <h2>1930s</h2>
      <p>In 1939, Vannevar Bush proposes the Memex hypertext device for microfiche: a hypertext-like device that is capable of allowing its users
        to go through a large set of documents stored on microfilm, connected via a network of “links” and “associative trails”. It was the ancestor of today's Web.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="empty"></div>
    <div class="decade-content" id="sixties">
      <h2>1960s</h2>
      <p>In 1960s, Doug Engelbart and Ted Nelson independently proposed "hypertext" - text that can be linked to another document or text.
         It is one of the key concepts that makes the internet work. Without it following links of the web would not be possible.</p>
      <p>In the same decade, ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was born. It was experimental computer network that was the forerunner of the Internet and
         the first network to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. Both of these technologies became the technical foundation of the internet.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="empty"></div>
    <div class="decade-content" id="seventies">
      <h2>1970s</h2>
      <p>In 1971, Ray Tomlinson invents email over ARPANET. The first email was sent between two machines next to each other.
         As R. Tomlinson recalled, the messages that were over it were “entirely forgettable and I have, therefore, forgotten them.”</p>
      <p>In 1973, the first connection to ARPANET was made when the University College London (UCL) and Norway's National Defence Research Establishment 
         joined via dedicated phone lines running at 9.6 kilobits per second.</p>   
      <p>In 1974, Vincent Cerf and Kahn invented Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) - 
         standard Internet communication protocols that enable computers to communicate over long distances (later they were split into TCP/IP).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="empty"></div>
    <div class="decade-content" id="eighties">
      <h2>1980s</h2>
      <p>In January 1, 1983, ARPANET adopts TCP/IP - the Internet of TCP/IP internets with 235 hosts. This was a “flag-day” style transition,
         meaning that all hosts were required to convert simultaneously or be left having to communicate using rather ad-hoc mechanisms.</p>
      <p>In 1984, Domain Name System (DNS) is introduced. DNS is responsible for assigning domain names and mapping those names to Internet resources 
         by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. In the same year JANET connected UK universities to Internet.</p>
      <p>In 1988, First Internet worm, the first great incidence of malware, known as the Morris Worm, affects 6,000 of 60,000 hosts. Its purpose was simply to propagate.
         One method it used to attempt access was to log in using embedded list of most popular passwords used by users.</p>
      <p>In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee proposes hypertext system for CERN. He suggested joining up hypertext with the early Internet of the time, thus 
         creating a system for sharing and distributing information globally.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="empty"></div>
    <div class="decade-content" id="nineties">
      <h2>1990s</h2>
      <p>In, 1991 CERN released World Wide Web technology (WWW). This changed the world as we know today. In November 2006 the American national newspaper USA Today
         and the American television show Good Morning America revealed a list of "New Seven Wonders" as chosen by six judges and the internet was one of them.</p>
      <p>1993 was a big year for the internet because GUI browsers became available for all platforms, CERN declared WWW technology free to use with no fees and 
         The Guardian published its first page on the Web.</p>  
      <p>In 1994, W3 Consortium (W3C or World Wibe Consortium) was founded and 1st International WWW conference was held in Geneva, Switzerland.
         In this year World Wide Web also became 2nd most popular service on the Internet (behind File Transfer Protocol), AltaVista search engine
         and Yahoo launched. 1994 was also the year when first banner ads appeared (you can check it out <a href="http://thefirstbannerad.com/">here</a>).</p>
      <p>In 1995, World Wide Web overtook Field Transfer Protocol as No. 1 internet service. In the same year Amazon and eBay launched. Eventually they became biggest
         e-commerce marketplaces.</p>
      <p>1998 was the year when Google launched. Today <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google.com</a> is the most visited website in the world.</p>

    <div class="empty"></div>
    <div class="decade-content" id="present">
      <h2>2000s - present</h2>
      <p>In 2001 CodeRed worm infiltrated thousands of Web servers and caused billions of dollars of damage. The Code Red worm was first discovered and researched 
         by eEye Digital Security employees Marc Maiffret and Ryan Permeh when it exploited a vulnerability that was discovere by Riley Hassell. The founders of
         "Code Red" named it so, because at the time when it was found they were drinking Code Red Mountain Dew.</p>
      <p>In 2003 nearly half of UK homes were connected to the internet. In the same year SQL slammer worm DDoS attack spreaded worldwide in 10 minutes 
         dramatically slowing down general Internet traffic. The program exploited a buffer overflow bug in Microsoft's SQL Server and Desktop Engine
         database products.</p>
      <p>In 2005 YouTube - the biggest video sharing website on the internet - launched.</p>
      <p>In 2007 Google became the “most valuable global brand” and most visited website in the world.</p>
      <p>In 2012 Facebook reached 1 billion monthly active users.</p>
      <p>In 2013 Netflix and YouTube accounted for over 50% of Internet traffic (in bytes).</p>
      <p>In 2016 the internet already had such a huge impact on people's lives that United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution on the promotion protection
         and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet.</p>
      <p>In 2017 Facebook and other social media services have been found to have been used by foreign governments to influence elections in the United States and other
         countries. This shows how powerful the internet is today.</p>
